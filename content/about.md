# About Fellowship of the Flux

## Our Story

Fellowship of the Flux began in Kansas City with a simple idea: everyone should have the opportunity to learn soldering skills in a supportive, hands-on environment. What started as volunteer-run workshops at local cybersecurity conferences like BSides KC and MakerFaire KC has grown into a regional resource for STEM education.

Our name playfully references the Fellowship of the Ring, emphasizing our belief that learning is a shared journey. Just as flux enables solder to flow and create strong connections, we help knowledge flow between experienced makers and eager learners, creating lasting connections in our community.

## Our Mission

**Advancing the art of learning to solder** through community outreach, education, and resource sharing.

We believe that soldering is more than a technical skill—it's a gateway to understanding electronics, building confidence in making and repairing, and connecting with a community of creators and problem-solvers.
