## Volunteer Spotlights

### Meet Our Amazing Volunteers

#### Sarah Chen - Lead Instructor
*Electronics Engineer, 5 years with Fellowship*

"I love seeing the moment when someone makes their first successful solder joint. There's this look of pride and accomplishment that makes all the volunteer time worthwhile. Teaching soldering isn't just about the technical skill—it's about building confidence and opening doors to the maker world."

#### Marcus Rodriguez - Equipment Manager
*Retired Technician, 3 years with Fellowship*

"Maintaining our lab equipment is my way of ensuring every learner has the best possible experience. When someone struggles with a cold solder joint, I want to know it's about technique, not faulty equipment. Quality tools make quality learning possible."

#### Dr. Jennifer Walsh - Educational Coordinator
*University Professor, 2 years with Fellowship*

"I bring my background in education to help us teach more effectively. Every learner is different, and our volunteers do an amazing job adapting their instruction style. We're not just teaching soldering—we're modeling how to be patient, encouraging teachers."
