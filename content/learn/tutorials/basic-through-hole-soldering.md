## Overview

Through-hole soldering is the foundation of electronics assembly. In this tutorial, you'll learn to create professional-quality solder joints that are both mechanically and electrically sound.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Set up your soldering station properly
- Create consistent, reliable solder joints
- Identify and correct common soldering defects
- Solder various through-hole components safely

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should:
- Have basic knowledge of electronic components
- Understand electrical safety principles
- Have read our [Soldering Safety Guide](/learn/guides/soldering-safety/)

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **Important Safety Information:**
- Always wear safety glasses when soldering
- Ensure adequate ventilation or use a fume extractor
- Keep your workspace clean and organized
- Never touch the soldering iron tip with bare hands
- Always return the iron to its stand when not in use

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace

Set up your soldering station in a well-lit, ventilated area:

1. **Position your soldering iron** in its stand
2. **Clean the work surface** and remove any flammable materials
3. **Arrange your tools** within easy reach
4. **Put on safety glasses** and ensure good lighting

**Tip:** A good workspace setup prevents accidents and improves soldering quality.

### Step 2: Heat and Tin Your Iron

Proper iron preparation is crucial for good solder joints:

1. **Heat the iron** to 350°C (660°F) for leaded solder
2. **Clean the tip** with a damp sponge
3. **Tin the tip** by applying a small amount of solder
4. **Wipe excess solder** leaving a thin, shiny coating

**Why tin the tip?** Tinning improves heat transfer and prevents oxidation.

### Step 3: Prepare Your Components

Before soldering, prepare your components properly:

1. **Bend component leads** to fit the board holes
2. **Insert components** from the component side
3. **Bend leads slightly** on the solder side to hold components
4. **Trim excess lead length** to about 2-3mm

### Step 4: Create Your First Solder Joint

Now for the actual soldering technique:

1. **Heat both the pad and component lead** simultaneously
2. **Apply solder to the joint** (not the iron tip)
3. **Remove solder first**, then the iron
4. **Hold the joint steady** until it cools (2-3 seconds)

**The key:** Heat the joint, not the solder!

### Step 5: Inspect Your Work

A good solder joint should have:
- **Shiny, smooth surface** (not dull or grainy)
- **Concave fillet shape** around the component lead
- **Complete coverage** of both pad and lead
- **No cold solder joints** or bridges

### Step 6: Practice Different Components

Try soldering various components to build your skills:

1. **Resistors** - Start with these as they're forgiving
2. **LEDs** - Practice polarity awareness
3. **Capacitors** - Learn about heat-sensitive components
4. **IC sockets** - Develop precision for multiple pins

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems and Solutions

**Cold Solder Joint**
- *Symptoms:* Dull, grainy appearance
- *Cause:* Insufficient heat or movement during cooling
- *Solution:* Reheat and allow proper cooling

**Solder Bridge**
- *Symptoms:* Solder connecting adjacent pins
- *Cause:* Too much solder or poor technique
- *Solution:* Use desoldering braid to remove excess

**Lifted Pad**
- *Symptoms:* PCB pad separates from board
- *Cause:* Excessive heat or mechanical stress
- *Solution:* Use jumper wire to restore connection

## Practice Exercises

1. **Solder 10 resistors** to perfboard in a neat row
2. **Create a simple LED circuit** with current-limiting resistor
3. **Practice desoldering** and component replacement
4. **Build a small project** like a simple flasher circuit

## Next Steps

After mastering through-hole soldering:
- Try [Surface Mount Soldering](/learn/tutorials/smd-soldering-basics/)
- Build your first [LED Flasher Project](/learn/projects/simple-led-flasher/)
- Learn about [Soldering Iron Maintenance](/learn/guides/iron-maintenance/)

## Assessment Questions

Test your understanding:

1. What temperature should you set for leaded solder?
2. Why do you tin the soldering iron tip?
3. What are the characteristics of a good solder joint?
4. How do you fix a cold solder joint?
