What an incredible weekend at BSides Kansas City 2024! Our soldering village had its most successful year yet, with over 180 participants learning hands-on electronics skills alongside the cybersecurity conference programming.

## By the Numbers

- **180+ participants** across both days
- **32 volunteers** providing instruction and support
- **Zero safety incidents** thanks to our rigorous protocols
- **15 new volunteers** recruited for future events
- **95% completion rate** for beginner projects
- **Ages 8-72** - our most diverse age range yet!

## What Made This Year Special

### Expanded Workshop Options

This year we offered three different tracks to accommodate various skill levels:

**Beginner Track: LED Badge Circuit**
Perfect for first-time solderers, participants built a simple LED badge with their name or favorite cybersecurity term. The project taught basic through-hole soldering while creating a fun takeaway.

**Intermediate Track: 555 Timer Flasher**
For those with some experience, we offered our classic LED flasher circuit using the versatile 555 timer IC. This project introduced more complex circuits and troubleshooting skills.

**Advanced Track: SMD Challenge**
New this year! Experienced participants tackled surface-mount components, learning techniques used in modern electronics manufacturing.

### Community Partnerships

We were thrilled to partner with several local organizations:

- **Kansas City Maker Space** provided additional volunteers and expertise
- **SparkFun Electronics** donated components for our project kits
- **Local IEEE Chapter** helped with advanced instruction
- **KC Women in Tech** promoted the event to underrepresented groups

### Volunteer Spotlight

Our volunteers were absolutely amazing this year. Special recognition goes to:

- **Sarah Chen** - Led the advanced SMD track with incredible patience and expertise
- **Tom Bradley** - Managed safety protocols flawlessly across both days
- **Lisa Park** - Coordinated with conference organizers and handled logistics
- **Alex Thompson** - Debuted new 3D-printed organizers that improved efficiency

## Participant Feedback

The response from participants was overwhelmingly positive:

*"I've been in cybersecurity for 10 years but never understood the hardware side. This workshop opened up a whole new world for me!"* - Conference attendee

*"My 12-year-old daughter and I did this together. She's already asking when we can do more electronics projects at home."* - Parent participant

*"The volunteers were so patient and encouraging. I was nervous about trying something new, but they made it feel safe to learn."* - First-time solderer

*"I loved the progression from basic to advanced. The SMD track was challenging but achievable with the great instruction."* - Experienced maker

## Behind the Scenes

### Setup and Logistics

Our portable lab setup continues to evolve and improve:

- **Friday evening setup** took just 2 hours with our experienced crew
- **New cart system** made equipment transport much more efficient
- **Improved ventilation** with additional fans for better air circulation
- **Enhanced safety stations** with updated first aid and emergency procedures

### Equipment Performance

Our investment in quality equipment paid off:
- **All 20 Hakko FX-888 stations** performed flawlessly throughout the weekend
- **Custom 3D-printed organizers** kept tools organized and accessible
- **New LED magnifiers** helped participants with detailed work
- **Upgraded fume extraction** improved air quality significantly

### Volunteer Coordination

Managing 32 volunteers across two days required careful planning:
- **Pre-event training session** ensured everyone knew their roles
- **Shift scheduling** prevented volunteer fatigue
- **Clear communication** through dedicated Slack channels
- **Real-time coordination** with volunteer coordinators on-site

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**Skill-Based Tracks**: Offering different difficulty levels kept everyone engaged and challenged appropriately.

**Safety Focus**: Our comprehensive safety briefing and continuous monitoring resulted in zero incidents.

**Community Partnerships**: Collaborating with local organizations expanded our reach and resources.

**Volunteer Training**: Pre-event preparation made everything run smoothly.

### Areas for Improvement

**Registration System**: We need better crowd management for peak times. Next year we'll implement a reservation system for popular time slots.

**Advanced Projects**: The SMD track was so popular we ran out of kits. We'll prepare more advanced options for future events.

**Documentation**: We want to create better take-home resources so participants can continue learning after the workshop.

**Space Layout**: The conference venue was great, but we learned how to optimize our setup for better traffic flow.

### New Volunteers

Fifteen participants expressed interest in volunteering with Fellowship of the Flux:
- **8 want to help** with future workshop instruction
- **4 are interested** in equipment management and setup
- **3 want to contribute** to content creation and curriculum development

### Follow-Up Engagement

We're staying connected with participants through:
- **Email newsletter** with project ideas and learning resources
- **Online community** for sharing projects and getting help
- **Local meetups** for continued learning and networking
- **Advanced workshops** for those wanting to develop further

### Organizational Partnerships

Several organizations expressed interest in hosting their own workshops:
