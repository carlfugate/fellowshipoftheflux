Welcome to Fellowship of the Flux! We're excited to share our mission of advancing the art of learning to solder through community outreach, education, and resource sharing.

## Our Story

Fellowship of the Flux began in Kansas City with a simple belief: everyone should have the opportunity to learn soldering skills in a supportive, hands-on environment. What started as volunteer-run workshops at local cybersecurity conferences like BSides KC and MakerFaire KC has grown into a regional resource for STEM education.

Our name playfully references the Fellowship of the Ring, emphasizing our belief that learning is a shared journey. Just as flux enables solder to flow and create strong connections, we help knowledge flow between experienced makers and eager learners.

## What We Do

### Portable Soldering Labs
Our carefully designed portable labs feature professional-grade equipment that we bring directly to events:
- 20+ Hakko FX-888 temperature-controlled soldering stations
- Custom 3D-printed organizers for tools and components
- Complete safety equipment and beginner-friendly project kits

### Community Workshops
We provide hands-on soldering education at:
- Cybersecurity conferences and maker faires
- Schools and libraries
- STEM education events
- Corporate team-building workshops

### Educational Resources
Through this website, we share:
- Step-by-step soldering tutorials for all skill levels
- Comprehensive guides for tools and techniques
- Hands-on projects with skill assessments
- Resources for building your own soldering education programs
