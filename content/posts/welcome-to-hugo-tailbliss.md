Welcome to our Hugo Tailbliss site! This post demonstrates the custom layouts and styling we've implemented to create a modern, responsive website.

## Features

Our site includes several key features:

### Modern Design
- **Responsive Layout**: Works beautifully on all devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid development

### Performance Optimized
- **Static Site Generation**: Fast loading times with Hugo
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image processing and WebP support
- **Asset Minification**: Optimized CSS and JavaScript for production

### Developer Experience
- **Custom Layouts**: Flexible template system for different content types
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable partials for consistent design
- **Build Pipeline**: Automated deployment with GitHub Actions

## Getting Started

To create a new post, use the Hugo archetype:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md
```

This will create a new post with the proper front matter structure.

## Customization

The site supports extensive customization through:

1. **Configuration**: Update `config.yaml` for site-wide settings
2. **Custom CSS**: Add styles in `assets/css/custom.css`
3. **Layout Overrides**: Modify templates in the `layouts/` directory
4. **Content Types**: Create new archetypes for different content structures

## What's Next?

Explore the site, check out the navigation, and see how the responsive design adapts to different screen sizes. Don't forget to try the dark mode toggle!

We're excited to see what you'll build with Hugo and Tailbliss.
