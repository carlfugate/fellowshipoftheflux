- Safety protocols needed improvement

### Version 2.0 (2021)
**Improvements**
- Upgraded to digital temperature-controlled stations
- Introduced basic 3D-printed organizers
- Implemented standardized safety procedures
- Expanded capacity to 15 stations

**Challenges**
- Organizers were fragile and hard to replace
- Transport system was still inefficient
- Ventilation was inadequate for larger groups
- Volunteer training needed systematization

### Version 3.0 (2022)
**Major Redesign**
- Professional Hakko stations for reliability
- Redesigned organizers with improved durability
- Rolling cart system for efficient transport
- Enhanced ventilation and safety systems

**Results**
- Setup time reduced to 2 hours
- Zero equipment failures during events
- Improved participant satisfaction scores
- Easier volunteer onboarding

### Version 4.0 (2024 - Current)
**Refinements**
- Modular organizer system for easy maintenance
- Integrated power distribution with GFCI protection
