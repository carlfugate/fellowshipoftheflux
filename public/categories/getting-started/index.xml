We&amp;rsquo;re excited to share our mission of advancing the art of learning to solder through community outreach, education, and resource sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-story"&gt;Our Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellowship of the Flux began in Kansas City with a simple belief: everyone should have the opportunity to learn soldering skills in a supportive, hands-on environment. What started as volunteer-run workshops at local cybersecurity conferences like BSides KC and MakerFaire KC has grown into a regional resource for STEM education.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
